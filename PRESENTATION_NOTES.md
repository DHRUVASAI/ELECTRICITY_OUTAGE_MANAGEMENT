### Potential Questions & Answers

**Q: Why did you choose Python and Java together?**
A: Python for rapid backend development and excellent Django framework, Java for type-safe, enterprise-grade frontend with Vaadin.

**Q: How do you handle security?**
A: JWT token authentication, password hashing with bcrypt, CORS configuration, and role-based access control.

**Q: Can this scale to handle many users?**
A: Yes, Django can be deployed with Gunicorn and Nginx, database can be PostgreSQL, and we can add caching with Redis.

**Q: What was the biggest challenge?**
A: Integrating two different languages and ensuring smooth communication through REST API while maintaining security.

**Q: How long did this take to build?**
A: Approximately 6 weeks including planning, development, testing, and documentation.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: The core functionality is complete. For production, we'd add more testing, monitoring, and deployment automation.

### Visual Aids Suggestions

For each slide, consider adding:
- **Architecture diagrams**: Use draw.io or Lucidchart
- **Screenshots**: Take actual screenshots of your running application
- **Code snippets**: Use syntax highlighting
- **Charts**: For analytics features
- **Icons**: For features and benefits
- **Flowcharts**: For user workflows

### Backup Plan

If demo fails:
1. Have screenshots of every feature
2. Have video recording of working demo
3. Walk through code instead
4. Show API responses in Postman
